# Upvest Java Client Examples

Examples how to use the [Upvest Investment API](https://docs.upvest.co) from JVM based languages. 



The API uses [message signatures](https://docs.upvest.co/documentation/concepts/api_concepts/authentication/http_message_signatures#the-role-of-http-message-signatures) based on [RFC 9421](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421).



The examples here are all work in progress and not officially supported by [Upvest](). Releases will also be published in [https://github.com/upvestco/http-signature-examples](https://github.com/upvestco/http-signature-examples).


Each subfolder is a stand-alone Java project, so if you want to import it into your IDE, don't import this folder, import one of the subfolders.
