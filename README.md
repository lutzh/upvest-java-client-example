Examples how to use the [Upvest Investment API](https://docs.upvest.co) from JVM based languages. 



The API uses [message signatures](https://docs.upvest.co/documentation/concepts/api_concepts/authentication/http_message_signatures#the-role-of-http-message-signatures) based on [RFC 9421](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421).
